1) Clone the repository, install node packages and verify routes locally
//on local
git clone https://github.com/hecmen84/testNasa
cd testNasa
npm install
npm start

Modules:
- ejs
- express
- Nodemon

Since this is not a complete app the logic is under /public/js route.
and the view under /views/welcome.ejs
I used Express expose the only one route and port is 5000
localhost:5000
